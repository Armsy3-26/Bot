# CPMIS CHATBOT 
## Introducing a New Chatbot :zap: :zap:
_This is an alternative chatbot to the one showcased during the hackathon on 19 Feb 2023. It offers both speed and efficieny in prediction, while using less computational power._

Our new chatbot offers a fresh approach to conversational AI, with advanced natural language processing and a user-friendly interface. Unlike the bot showcased during the hackathon, our chatbot does not sacrifice speed at the expense of efficiency. Additionally, it offers real-time communication capabilities that greatly improve the user experience. One key difference between our chatbot and the successful bot is that we use a topic modeling library instead of a deep learning library. This enables our chatbot to better understand and respond to user queries, while also reducing computational overhead and enabling more efficient use of system resources. With these advantages and many more, we believe our chatbot will quickly become the preferred choice for anyone seeking a fast, efficient, and engaging conversational experience.
