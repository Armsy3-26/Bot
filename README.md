# CPMIS CHATBOT 
## Introducing a New Chatbot :zap: :zap:
_This is an alternative chatbot to the one showcased during the hackathon on 19 Feb 2023. It offers both speed and efficieny in prediction, while using less computational power._

Our new chatbot offers a fresh approach to conversational AI, with advanced natural language processing and a user-friendly interface. Unlike the bots showcased during the hackathon, our chatbot does not sacrifice speed at the expense of efficiency. Additionally, it offers **real-time communication capabilities that greatly improve the user experience**. 
One key difference between our chatbot and the successful bot is that we use a _topic modeling library instead of a deep learning library_. This enables our chatbot to better understand and respond to user queries, while also **reducing computational overhead** and enabling more efficient use of system resources. With these advantages and many more, we believe our chatbot will quickly become the preferred choice for anyone seeking a fast, efficient, and engaging conversational experience.
